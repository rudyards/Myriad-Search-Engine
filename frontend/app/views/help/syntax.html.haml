      If you have any suggestions for new useful syntax, feel free to contact me.

    %h4 Search by at least one printing with given property
    %div
      Search engine generally operates printing by printing,
      but sometimes you might want to search for card properties between printings.
      <code>in:</code> operator matches any card with at least one printing of given property.
    %ul

    %h4 Time travel
    %div You can travel to any time by specifying set code, set name, or full date (partial date like "1999" will be interpretted as "1 January 1999"). Cards printed since then won't be returned, and status of various formats will be as it was at that time. So if you want to argue about what was best Modern Pod deck back in that time just roll back the time to before the ban and enjoy.

    %div Formats should generally be fully accurate from 2004 onwards (Legacy/Vintage split), information about older times might contain inaccuracies.

    %div You can specify multiple time periods with use of parentheses.

    %h4 Sort results
    %div Use sort: operator to order results in a different way. By default alphabetical sorting is used.
    %div Results with equal sort key are then sorted by name.
    %div Missing values (like cards with no cmc when sorting by cmc) go last.
    %div You can use minus to reverse search order, or comma to specify multiple search keys.
